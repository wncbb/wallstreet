Shen, how long have you been in acting classes?
I have been in the class for 6 month.
Do you like your class?
Yes, I do, but I'm unhappy with my teacher.
Why don't you look for a different class then?
Actually, I called a couple of schools in a past month.
What did they say?
It seems like I can't start until the beginning of the next semester.
That would be in a month. Have you seen other schools yet?
I went to one and it looks really great.


Hello X. Why didn't you come to the meeting this moring?
My train was late. It's difficult for me, because I don't know what time it will get to work.
You mean the train is unreliable?
Yes, that's right. I always leave very early and arrive late.
Is there another meaning transport you can use?
In the beginning, I got the bus across town. It was easy!
Oh, you used to use the bus. Why did you stop?
The bus used to go straight through the park, but now it goes around the whole city!
Have you thought about riding a bike to work?
It's too cold here. I don't know what to do.
