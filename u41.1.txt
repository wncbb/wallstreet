Hey, Jim. I'm glad you made it. It's great to meet up for lunch.
Hello. Yes, I agree, It's good to see you.
Where's Jeicy? I thought she was coming too.
She could be  on the train . I tried to call her, and she did't answer.
She should be here in any minutes then. She doesn't live that far. I'm meeting another frind in about an hour.So I hope she gets here soon.
Well, the food shouldn't take long since there are not many people in this restaurant.
I heard the food is good here. I wonder if they had salads.
We could look at the menu first.
That's a good idea. They have salads. but the pulst looks good.
I heard pult is amazing here. You should get the pulst..
