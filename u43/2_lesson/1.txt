I think this meeting is going to be much harder than I thought.
Don't worry, I have had lots of meetings with the big boss. And I was much less prepared than you.
Really? What does that feel like?
I was terrified. It means? so nerves to go in there without knowing what he would say.
I would be a bit more relaxed if I can talk a lot more.
If you want, I'll help you.
That would be great. I'm so glad I don't have to prepare alone.
I always feel very nervers before meeting with the big boss too.
I'm not even the meeting stops.  What I can do to relax?
If you stop focusing on the big boss, you'll be OK.
