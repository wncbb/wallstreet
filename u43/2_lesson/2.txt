Can you explain this graph to me?
Sure. The blue line shows how many products the company sold.
And this high point on the blue line?
This is the peak of how many products the company sold.
Why does it go down?
It shows the decrease in sales.
I see. What about the pie chart? What does the green show?
The green shows how many custumers are children.
OK. What does the yellow show?
The yellow shows how many customers are adults.
