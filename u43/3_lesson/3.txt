Hey, Nicky. What's the interesting story you want to tell me?
Hi, Joel. I read an article that they are shooting a movie in the park uptown.
Really? That's exciting. Who is in it?
Tilly Smith, your favorite actress is in it.
You are kidding. I can't believe an actress that famous would be in our city.
I know. I'm very surprised too.
So how long will they be shooting for?
Well, the article said whey will be here for 2 weeks. Then theny are going to China.
Really? Why China?
There's a scene where they make silk scarves. Did you know the silk was invented in China?
Wow. I didn't know that. What's the movie about?
The article didn't say. I guess we need to wait until we ...out.
