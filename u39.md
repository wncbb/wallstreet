both of us did.
neither of us is strong enough to carry this.
after doing this, all of us should go get lunch.
i wonder if there's anything in here.
I don't think either of us will ever be professional movers.

Hi, Awo.

Hey, Arif. How's going?

Things are going well. I heared you and your roommate are moving to a new apartment.  Is your new apartment near your job?

Yeah, We're moving downtown. Both of us work there.

Did you find a nice big apartment?

Well, it's bigger than our old one. None of apartment downtown are really big.

Let me know when you are in your new place.

I will for sure. So how about you? What are you doing these days?

I get a new Job. Actually I work in downtown now too.

That's great! Let's have lunch soon. But right now I have to go. I'll see you later.
