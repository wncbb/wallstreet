Good evening. This is Susan from Channel 4 news. I'm joined by Kal with our top stories.
Hi, I'm Kal. Tonight's story is big. A man robbered the First Street Bank.
Rob the first street bank? Tell us the story, Kal.
The robbery happened just after 11:30 A.M. Next, he hijacked a taxi. There was a little boy in the taxi.
A little boy?
Yes, so he kidnapped and asked the little boy's parents for money.
And then what happened?
Well, the parents reported this to the police, and the police caught the man.
