I'm planning my trip to LA. Can you help me?
Sure, I think it's a good idea if we look at this new travel website.

Great, thanks. So, I need a flight and i'm hoping to stay by the sea. i want a place as beautiful as the one i visited un last year.
So you are saying you want me to find a flight and a hotel room?

Yes, and I'd love to have a luxury hotel, can you see anything like that ?
Look at this great hotel! The view is as beautiful as the one last year.

Fantastic. It's amazing. How much is it?
It costs 500 dollars a night, but the point is any hotel by the sea will be expensive.

I love it. Let's look at the price of flights before I decide. How much are they?
You're lucky. The flights are not as expensive as last year. Here's one for $600.
